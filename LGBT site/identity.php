	<h2>Finding your Identity</h2>

<div id="center">
    <p> So, you’ve recently realized your queer, but just what kind of queer are you?
      Finding yourself can be a lengthy process; at times more challenging than anything
      you’ve had to go through thus far in your life, but don’t forget that this process
      is rewarding too!  It can be exciting and rewarding to find a label you identify with,
      and a community through that label.  Maybe you still need help finding this label;
      this site should help out with that!  Maybe you don’t really want to pick a label
      at all; that’s super chill too!  Either way, it can be useful to have the terminology
      to describe how you might feel right now, so it’s not a bad idea to check out some of
      these videos to help you do that!</p>
