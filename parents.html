  <h2>For Parents</h2>

    <p class = "purple"> This is a site that will help your child grow comfortable with themselves,
      and grow into the happy, healthy, kind adults they ought to be.  This is also
      a site that you can use as a helpful reference to become more comfortable with
      things like labels and coming out, which are probably the most pressing issues
      in your childâ€™s life right now when it comes to how they identify and how they
      fit into the LGBTQ+ spectrum.  You too can use this site to become more knowledgeable
      on all things LGBT!  You might also notice that this site is written with a youthful
      frame of reference.  As much as this site can be for you too, it first and foremost
      focuses on your child and helping them better utilize a resource readily available to them.  </p>

      <p class = "extra">  As a parent, you should encourage your child to go out and find queer resources.
        Just like it is for them, it might be difficult for you to process what is happening right now, but
        right now they probably need you love and support more than ever before.  You too should watch some youtube
        videos! Learn about the experiences they are having, better equip yourself to empathize with your child,
        better equip yourself to care for an LGBTQ+ child.  It will make both you and your child happier in the long run.
