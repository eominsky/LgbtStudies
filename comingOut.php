  <h2>Coming Out</h2>

	<p> As someone who may have only very recently “come out” to yourself, you’re probably
     wondering what it’ll be like to come out to everyone else.  Will it go well? Maybe!
     Will it suck butt? Who knows? But here you can see a bunch of coming out stories, good and bad,
     and become a bit more familiar with what the general process is like, giving you a better idea
     of how things might go for you too!

    <p> To start off, check out this video! It's fun, uplifting, and just a bit over the top.
      the creator of this video, Elle  Mills, is vulnerable, she shares her fears of coming out,
      she shares why she has these fears, and finally she shares why she really didn't need to have them in the first place.
      Elle finds love from her family and her friends, and comes out in style (which could provide inspiration for you coming out too!)
