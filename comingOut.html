  <h2>Coming Out</h2>

	<p class = "extra"> As someone who may have only very recently “come out” to yourself, you’re probably
     wondering what it’ll be like to come out to everyone else.  Will it go well? Maybe!
     Will it suck butt? Who knows? But here you can see a bunch of coming out stories, good and bad,
     and become a bit more familiar with what the general process is like, giving you a better idea
     of how things might go for you too!
</p>

    <p class = "red"> To start off, check out this video! It's fun, uplifting, and just a bit over the top.
      the creator of this video, Elle  Mills, is vulnerable, she shares her fears of coming out,
      she shares why she has these fears, and finally she shares why she really didn't need to have them in the first place.
      Elle finds love from her family and her friends, and comes out in style (which could provide inspiration for your coming out too!)

    </p>

  Ok, I'll be honest with you, not all coming out stories are perfect.  This video is an example
  of a coming out story not quite going as planned.  (SPOILER it ends well though don't be afraid~).
  Just like how you might be stuggling with your identity, parents do too.  It can be a learning process for all of us,
  but hopefully it'll all work out in the end.

  Woo this one is ~lengthy~, but also so detailed and intimate and heart warming.  Hear from a femme lesbian about what its like to come out after having lived a straight life for a while!
  Ingrid is proof of how good it feels to come out!

  Coming out doesn't have to be a big deal, even if right now it seems like it does.  This story is a clear example of what happens when you overthink it.  It's a big moment, but don't be afraid.

Alright so we've seen a lot of feel good stories thus far, but not all of them are so bright and cheery and uplifting.  This video sadly showcases something that happens all to often,
a coming out story gone wrong.  It's really sad, and I hope that nothing like this ever happens to you, but its important to know that this is a possibility, and to be prepared for the worst.
If you are in a home where its not safe to be yourself, make sure you have the resources to take care of yourself before you come out to your family.  It's ok to wait a bit longer too if you need to.
Please please plan ahead and try to prepare yourself for all that may come.

<p class = "purple"> Let's end on something a bit nicer. This video tells some more coming out stories of some random people who are *Not* YouTube famous, and they offer up pretty average and  stereotypical experiences, which are good to see too.
