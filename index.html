    <h2>A site for LGBTQ+ Youth</h2>

    <div id="center">


            <p class = "white">Are you someone who is exploring their gender or sexual identity?
               Do you sometimes feel like you like someone outside the societal norms
               that are shaped by heterosexuality? Do you feel like you personally exist
               outside those norms?  Well then, you’ve come to the right place!
               This site will help you learn more about yourself and provide what you will
               hopefully come to find as valuable resources for your life and growth right now!
             </p>

               Ok, I realize there are a lot of words here, but here's a fun (and ~relatable~) song to listen to while you read it!
               </p>
           <p class = "red">
              On this site I'll highlight coming out stories that I think are worth watching, good and bad,
              from famous and not so famous people on YouTube.  I'll talk about what it is about them that makes them important,
              and why I think they have the potential to help you right now.
            </p>

            <p class = "orange">
             I am focused on providing YOU, as a young member of the LGBTQ+ community, with the tools need to better utilize YouTube and its resources, particularly when finding yourself identities and coming out to your friends and families.  It is very likely that you are at a place your life where you are figuring out who you are and how to tell the people you care about. Even a site like YouTube can be overwhelming at times due to the wide array of videos available.  Why sift through all of that when I could do it for you? I have curated a collection of videos that will inspire and motivate you to express yourself (and hopefully help you find other people like you)! </p>
             <p class = "yellow">
               On the Coming Out page, I’ll show you some stories of people coming out of the closet as a non-cis/hetero identity that really encompass the coming out experience, good and bad.  It is important to keep all possibilities in perspective, and while everyone like to hear a feel good story, it is important to remember that even in 2018 that is not always the case.
            </p>
            <p class = "green">
              On the Identity page,  I will offer up some videos that explain different identity labels, and the ways in which this information can be valuable to you.  These videos can often be the first time you are able to learn about these different identities and understand how these identities relate to might relate to you.
            </p>
            <p class = "blue"> On the Parents page, I’ll talk about why it’s important that they give you the space to explore, and support you as they do so.   I will provide resources to parents that better equip them to aid you in these ways. I’ll also talk about how these videos provide an opportunity for lgbtq+ youth (like you!) to see others like them, and learn that they are not the only ones feeling the way they do in this moment, and that there are other people like them out there in the world.   
            </p>

            <p class = "purple">	Finally, on the Resources page, I’ll provide valuable resources available for those who need someone to talk to, or are particularly struggling right now.  Finding yourself isn’t easy, so you shouldn’t feel afraid to reach out if you need help.  Things don’t always go as planned either, so having a backup plan in case something goes wrong, and preparing yourself in advance for anything that may happen is a great idea! This page should help you do just that.
            </p>

            <p class = "white">
              HOPE YOU ENJOY
            </p>
