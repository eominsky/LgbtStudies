    <h2>A site for LGBTQ+ Youth</h2>

    <div id="center">


            <p class = "white">Are you someone who is exploring their gender or sexual identity?
               Do you sometimes feel like you like someone outside the societal norms
               that are shaped by heterosexuality? Do you feel like you personally exist
               outside those norms?  Well then, you’ve come to the right place!
               This site will help you learn more about yourself and provide what you will
               hopefully come to find as valuable resources for your life and growth right now!
             </p>

           <p class = "red">
              On this site I'll highlight coming out stories that I think are worth watching, good and bad,
              from famous and not so famous people on YouTube.  I'll talk about what it is about them that makes them important,
              and why I think they have the potential to help you right now.
            </p>

            <p class = "orange">
             This site focuses on providing you, as a young member of the LGBTQ+ community, with the tools need to better utilize YouTube and its resources, particularly when finding yourself identities and coming out to your friends and families.  It is very likely that you are at a place your life where you are figuring out who you are and how to tell the people you care about.  I have curated a collection of videos that will inspire and motivate you to express express yourself (and hopefully help you find other people like you)! </p>
             <p class = "yellow">
               On the Coming Out page, I’ll show you some stories of people coming out of the closet as a non-cis/hetero identity that really encompass the coming out experience, good and bad. coming out videos, which are videos in which people share their first experiences with.   It is important to keep all possibilities in perspective, and while everyone like to hear a feel good story, it is important to remember that even in 2018 that is not always the case.
            </p>
            <p class = "green">
              On the Identity page,  I will offer up some videos that explain different identity labels, and the ways in which this information can be valuable to you.  These videos can often be the first time you are able to learn about these different identities and understand how these identities relate to might relate to you.
            </p>
            <p class = "blue"> On the Parents page, I’ll talk about why it’s important that they give you the space to explore, and support you as they do so.   I will provide resources to parents that better equip them to aid you in these ways. I’ll also talk about the the sense of community created by these videos, and argue that they not only create a visible sense of community through their comment sections, but provide an opportunity for lgbt youth (like you!) to see others like them, and learn that they are not the only ones feeling the way they do in this moment, and that there are other people like them out there in the world.   I will also take some time to discuss the ways in which YouTube and its videos have influenced the coming out process in itself. By this I mean that, by making marginalized identities visible, it normalizes them and provides much needed resources to lgbtq+ youth.  This goes somewhat outside the bounds of education, as it is not focused on the facts so much as it is focused on the experience of both those sharing their stories and those hearing them.
            </p>

            <p class = "purple">	Finally, on the Resources page, I’ll provide valuable resources available for those who need someone to talk to, or are particularly struggling right now.  Finding yourself isn’t easy, so you shouldn’t feel afraid to reach out if you need help.  Things don’t always go as planned either, so having a backup plan in case something goes wrong, and preparing yourself in advance for anything that may happen is a great idea! This page should help you do just that.
